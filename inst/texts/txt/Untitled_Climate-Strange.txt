Before I opine prosaically impudent words upon Climate
Change/Global Warming, I will provide an utterance on

Restrictive dogma on the impossibilities of possibilities in a
supra-human animal Universe of Universes
Easily biased by the guiding influences of tha
Intelligentsia/Illuminati who have tried to disparage anything
that extends beyond the reaches of “Real Science”
wAsn’t (& Isn’t) Eugenics & ALL of its descendants “REal Science”
Let us complete the list: Human-induced [not bacterial-induced}
biotechnologies (genetic engineering, cloning, genetically
modified organisms, genetically engineered “food,” “disease”
engineering, the Human Genome Project, stem cell research,
etc.}, population control measures designed to alleviate the
concern with the human carrying capacity of our Mother Earth

lacking a Systems view of Life in its myriad of interconnections,
hidden & manifest, throughout each of the Worlds
be Careful to recognize that we have only a limited complete
understanding of the Whole of Nature
Insist on being
humblE
kNow that Creativity/Creation is more encompassing than
knowledge alone
surely intelligenCe is not the end all & be all of our existence in
this place at this particular junction of temporal & spatial
dimensionality

Expect that human-based biases will inflect scientific processes
& that Real Science must include Reality (which can not always
be reduced [reductionism} or organized systematically -- systems
thinking -- as humans can only comprehend or view what they
allow to be perceived & later interpreted in their flat EArth
consciousness -- just those that have not elevated their mindset
above a level ground datum

Now back to

Global means worldwide, the Whole Earth, Mother Earth, Gaia,
international, all 7 continents & the roughly 70% bodies of water,
the apparent & obscure worlds, ALl the dimensions, North,
South, East, & West therefore global is not restricted to onLy 1
nation, a group of countries, or particular regions
Of course all aspects of Life are in constant flux
change is inevitaBle
thus climAte can, has, & will have its transformations too
tha probLems of the orb are intimately related & interconnected
& must be solved as such

Wishing away radical, spiritual science does not make it go away
Awareness
Refuse to be bought & sold by the highest bidder
becoMe a whistleblower
thermodynamIcs as a component of Global Warming/Climate
Change debates
ackNowledge Ur funding source {foundations, organizations,
individuals, financial institutions, colleges & universities,

“corporament” = corporate + government)
thinkinG beyond: Sacred Geometry, nonlinear
dynamics/complexity theory, chaos theory/fractal intelligence,
systems thinking, ecological literal thinking, Creativity
Consciousness, Peace & Love within

/////////

Coming with stronger & more frequent storms
Lurking in the backdrop of the debate: HAARP, cloud seeding,
chemtrails, & other methods of altering climates & human states
of consciousness
the market Is not the answer, it has greatly exacerbated many of
our interrelated quandries
Meet the Earth & thy shall know thy Self
reseArch via the Internet, libraries, journals & magazines,
newspapers, television & personal observations & experiences
Tell others
Expect backlash from skeptics with powerful backers

Come to Ur own conclusions
Happiness & laughter in times of opportune impossible
possibilities
Act in y(our) best interests
kNow your place & your purpose in this location
act Globally & locally
Encourage others to ask the ?’s that have difficult & challenging
answers

Ultimately what we do or don’t do is our Choice

Ethnocentric overtones, though aLl encompassing
United against the weak & infirmed
Guided by population control fears
Experiments with humans
Not a relic of the past, continues today
Includes forced sterilizations
Controversial though not widely known
Selective gene pooling for reeding purposes

Earth tilts
Carbon dioxide raises the Earth closer to our Star -- the Sun
Ice Age or Global Warming?
Non-human focused (volcanic activity, digestive gases expelled
by non-human animals, respiration, and so on) or human-focused
(greenhouse gases, power plants, lawn mowers, automobiles,
“fossil” fuels & non-”fossil” fuels, and so on)?
Geologic time versus human-centered time?
Heat island effects
Hot stormwater runoff
Acid deposition
Air/water/land/terrestrial body pollution
Carbon source or sink?
Microbial factories
False science is lame
Biomimic photosynthesis
Science is God or Science is a Student-Teacher?
Laws are meant to be broken when not absolute.

Our ways are evolving
Aliens-R-Us
Relate this to us All
What do these lines have to do w/ the previous focused
indignations of the topic of Science?
“I don’t know.”

You, the artistic renderer interpreter, must decide what U think
about these coniptions.

Space-age conspiracies abound in jumbled thoughts
circumnavigating alpha & beta brainwaves in this Earthly vessel
prosecting on the Designs of Life.
Some things are trife, others are rife for exploratory enthusiasm.
Blast off to outer space so that we can reDefine our inner space.
Realize the magnitude of yr thoughts on Ur actions.
Remember that Science is Everywhere.

Spellbound yourself for a tale.

Represent in the Universal Game of Life.

Know the movies of your piece.

Peace is a corollary function of the mind feeding off of Love.

Love is Pure Energy indeed.

All Life is Pure Energy indeed.

Subatomic particles to waves to super strings.

Entropy at its best is organized confusive conscriptions.

Play it safe.

Safe food for everyone (Real Food just tastes better].

A soldier of fortune is still a mercenary.

Don’t we all have national mercenary forces?
The “People Behind the Uniforms” must unbecome their
conditioning.

The People United in Love can overcome our dictatorial rulers.

Our rulers can not contort our Science, Politics, and Religious
Spiritualities 4-Ever.
We’ll Wake-Up soon enough or it’ll be too late.

Leave the conspirators at the door & enter w/ your hidden 3rd
Eye.

Don’t sign your Life over to their Way of Life.

The elites have divided us, but not yet conquered us.

They must not vanquish our Spirits.

Spirit is Pure Energy.

Pure Energy is Breath.

Breath is LIfe.

Life is Love.

Life is Good.

Good is Energy.

We must seek inner to heal the outer.

Food is a wise medicine.

Medicine is only a tool, not the Way.

Health is a Way.

Eugenics for master breeding of the elite bloodlines. Royalty
incestuous relations are not the only. Follow the bloodlines & tha
money.

Money is an illusion. Credit is a bigger illusion.

Gift the Economy.

Free Software 4 all.

Cocaine residue falling from tha sky in a state of emergency.

Continuity of Government (COG) since WW II & still operates
today.

Nuclear power whereas the reactor is millions of miles away is a
free energy source.

Authenticate U. Be freely responsible.

Forgiveness is a Divine Act.

There are many facets of Science booming out of your booming
creatively mental Spiritual appliance.
