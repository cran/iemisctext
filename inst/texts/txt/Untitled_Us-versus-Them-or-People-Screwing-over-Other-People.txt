Close your eyes and envision a world full of possibility and
freedom

Now reopen your eyes and look at the world around you:
           This ain’t it

We’ve got anotha illegit
President
Time for tha Board of Directors to install a new figurehead
Forget tha voice of da people

They won’t react
We gave ‘em crack
Can’t forget opium and heroin

They know no one’s got their back
We gave ‘em freedom, they won’t move off that couch

They don’t realize tha 13th Amendment legalized enslavement
for punishment
Can’t forget tha Dred Scott case –
Still on tha books

We gave ‘em repression and brutality in all forms
They asked for more protection from us by us

We gave ‘em COINTELPRO
They accepted our fairy tale versions of old and new wars at
home and abroad
We gave them experiments and forced sterilizations

They don’t mind as long as it’s Not In Their Backyard – it seems
they don’t mind if its in their NAME
We allow them to believe they have freedom

They won’t fight back if we take it all back
We do it for their sake – in their Name

They want us to spy on their neighbor
We’ll deny it if they ask

They will accept our view, they know better
We’ll label them “conspiracy theorists” and unpatriotic

They will continue protesting for reforms and not seek real
change – Revolution
We’ll give them solutions to the symptoms and not the problems

They will ask us to read their e-mails and monitor their
conversations – can’t be sure who’s a “terrorist” and who’s not
We will break any and all national and international laws &
agreements as we please, in their NAME

They will cheer when we demand their response
We will indefinitely keep their friends, classmates, family
members, neighbors, and fellow global citizens

They will demand their freedoms to be confiscated
We will gladly accept

They will never know the Truth
We’ll hide it in “independent” committees that will never get
anywhere

They will say 3000 Americans died
We will not challenge that false statement, though we know
3000 or so people died from all over the globe

They will allow and fight in our wars to secure control of tha last
drops of oil & gas and clean water
We will wage war to protect them (that’s right – them –
international financiers and corporate executives)

Did you think we would protect the people?

Remember they gave us back their voice and freedom

We hope they enjoy the economic collapse and the ecological
crisis
They won’t make us claim responsibility for anything

We will point fingers at tha otha head on this one body politic
They will not accept responsibility – they are only consumers
with no freedoms to read, to associate & assemble, to speak
freely and to “speak the Truth to Power, ” and to redress the
gov’ment in hopes of having a reform in policy

We know it’ll take a radical transformation to change the world
for tha better. We won’t say it for tha public eye though.
They will refuse to see this

In the end, those with freedom and those without will realize that
we all live on one planet
If we enjoy clean air, water, land, and bodies, then we must
reclaim our most basic freedom

The freedom to transform our government and society for tha
benefit of all.

We all know ANOTHER WORLD IS POSSIBLE
